Hi, my name is C Andrew Basham (he/him/his)

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Profile! As an epidemiologist I use GitHub to advance open science principles and practices, providing reproducible and auditable research records.

I also have a [Quarto/GitHub Page website](https://candrewbasham.github.io/web/), which contains my CV, portfolio with links to my works, and statistical software from published research papers.
