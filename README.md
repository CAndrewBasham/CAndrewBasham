Hi, my name is C Andrew Basham (he/him/his)

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Profile! 

I am open to communicating about collaboration if you see potential synergy between our work. 

If you see anything that needs attention or have suggestions, please feel free to send me a GitHub issue, an email, or reach out through any platform below.

I made a [Quarto/GitHub Page website](https://candrewbasham.github.io/web/) to illustrate the items listed in my CV and to increase my Quarto and GitHub skills. 

Looking forward to advancing open science and reproducible research with fellow epidemiologists, other academic researchers, and the people we work for to improve public health.

Sincerely,

**C. Andrew Basham, PhD**
