Hi, my name is C Andrew Basham (he/him/his)

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Profile! 

I am an epidemiologist focused on:

1. causal inference in survivorship research;
2. missing data structure, and in causal inference;
3. race and ethnicity data provenance, quality, and responsible use.

I use GitHub to advance open science principles and practices by providing reproducible and auditable research.

I also have a [Quarto/GitHub Page website](https://candrewbasham.github.io/web/), which contains my CV, portfolio with links to my works, and statistical software from published research papers. 

If you see anything that needs attention or have suggestions, please feel free to reach out.

Sincerely,

**C. Andrew Basham, PhD**
